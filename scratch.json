initialState =

when a user registers, questions are loaded in, head defaults to 0 (1st question in array, right?--whatever head points to is the question displayed) 

username: {
  type: String
},
password: {
  type: String
},
questions: [
  {
      _id: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
      question: String,
      answer: String,
      memoryStrength: Number,
      next: Number
  }
],
head: {
  type: Number,
  default: 0
}
});

upon log in, instead of fetching to questions, fetch to '/next' endpoint.  Need to write an endpoint on the server side for this.  Make sure code displays what is head is pointing to.

When user submits answer, m value will change and next value will change.  This needs to be updated on the database, so fetch with patch method will be needed.  need to write a patch endpoint on server side for this



//save the value of the current head
